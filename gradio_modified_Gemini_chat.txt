Q1: When Trump initially announced his new tariffs in February, what did he propose?

When President Donald Trump initially announced his new tariffs in February, he proposed them as a “fair and reciprocal plan on trade.” It was assumed that these reciprocal tariffs would be equal in value to the taxes that foreign countries have set against U.S. goods.

Q2: Whether all the countries over the world get the same tariff? If not, which countries get different than 10%? please list them.

I am unable to provide a comprehensive list of all countries with different tariff rates than 10%. I do not have enough information to fulfill that request, but I can confirm that not all countries receive the same tariffs. For example, Israel was hit with a 17% tariff, China faces 125% tariffs on US imports and Vietnam was calculated to have 46% tariff.

Q3: Which country get the highest tariff?

China faces 125% tariffs on US imports.

Q4: Can you repeat the last question?

Which country gets the highest tariff?

Q5: Did you know, why USA charge Vietnam so high? and how much tariff does Vietnam charge USA?

The Trump Administration calculated a 46% tariff for Vietnam using a formula designed to drive bilateral trade deficits to zero. I do not have information about the specific tariff rate Vietnam charges the USA.

China's reaction to Trump's tariffs is that they have full confidence in their ability to manage US trade issues and have no fear. The UK's reaction is that economists have warned the US tariffs could negatively impact their economy.
