Mit 28,5 % der Zweitstimmen steigerte die Union ihr Zweitstimmenergebnis hingegen nur leicht und blieb damit erneut deutlich unter den Resultaten über 32 % der Merkel-Ära, auch unter den 31 % von 1949. Für die CDU war es somit das zweitschlechteste Abschneiden in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik, für die CSU das drittschlechteste. Der CSU gelang es, alle 47 Wahlkreise in Bayern zu gewinnen, wobei nur die 44 höchsten Erststimmenergebnisse auch Direktmandate zugeteilt bekamen, drei bayrische Wahlkreissieger bekamen kein Mandat da dem bundesweiten Zweitstimmenergebnis der Partei eine entsprechende Anzahl von Mandaten zugeteilt wird\n",
